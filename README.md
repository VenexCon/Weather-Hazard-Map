# Weather-Hazard-Map
This is my take on the weather app project as part of The Odin Project cirriculum.

This project is a safety minded take on a typical weather app using the Async, Await keywords.
 
The premise is that users will be able to view the current and 5-day forecast with the website then providing Hazards present.
The users can then plan their journey with sufficient knowledge and information.

Features to be added include:
Heat index notification
Hurricanes, and wind speed classification 
More fluid text box animations.
Redesigned color scheme. 
User login and auth.
Possible local storage.
